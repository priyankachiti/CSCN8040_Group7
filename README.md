# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Testing

This Jupyter Notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical tests for comparison, and hypothesis evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (recommended: Python 3.7+). Install the required dependencies using the following commands:

- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install pandas`
- `pip install numpy`
- `pip install scipy`
- `pip install seaborn`

## Execution Steps

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**
   - Run the following command in your terminal to start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the `EDA_Statastical_Test.ipynb` file.

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - The notebook includes data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - Run the respective cells to generate visual insights such as histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.

3. **Conduct Statistical Tests**
   - The notebook applies statistical tests such as:
     - **t-test** for comparing means
     - **ANOVA** for multiple group comparisons
     - **Chi-square test** for categorical data
   - Run the respective code cells to compute and interpret statistical values.

4. **Evaluate Hypothesis**
   - The notebook assesses hypotheses based on statistical test results.
   - Look for `p-value` calculations and conclusions regarding accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis.

## Output Interpretation
- **Visualization Insights**: Identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
- **Statistical Tests**: Compare groups based on means, variances, or categorical distributions.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Make data-driven decisions based on significance levels.

## Notes
- Ensure datasets are correctly loaded before running analyses.
- Modify the test parameters as per dataset requirements.
